          <p>Think Faster Talk Smarter is a book written by Matt Abrahams, an expert in communication and a Stanford University professor, who teaches organizational behaviour. Communication is the lifeline of any relationship- be it personal or professional. Interestingly, while our educational system prepares us for communication in a formal setting - such as delivering a presentation, writing clear emails, rehearsed conversations etc., it doesnâ€™t coach us for speaking in an informal setting...</p>

           <p>Love is an emotion that has always intrigued me. It is loaded with lot of contrarian feelings- you need the person you love to be possessive about you yet need your space; you need that person to respect your thoughts and let you do things on your course yet you want that person to offer their unsolicited views, and I could go on and on about how this universal feeling called "LOVE" is so unfathomable. Perhaps, this is why, no matter how many movies are done around the central theme of love, new ones with fresh perspective like "Lover" still is celebrated by the audience.</p>

           <p>Vignesh Raja's debut movie Por Thozhil revolves around the story where 2 cops are on a mission to hunt down a serial killer.  This is a stereotypical theme, which Kollywood audience are used to from the days of Sigappu Rojakkal but the director has navigated through the plot with rich twists and tight screenplay, maintaining the suspense all through the movie.</p>

          <p>'Woman+ Unmarried+ Approaching one's 30s' is a perfect combination that would invite unabated sympathies and advise from one's friends(married) and family. Archana 31 Not Out portrays the life of one such woman, Archana(played by Aishwarya Lekshmi), who struggles to find the right groom for her. And when she eventually thinks she has found one, a twist awaits her. </p>

          <p>None likes facing crisis in life but we all know that it is inevitable though it's form and severity may vary. Some crisis could impact self while some like Covid 19 could impact people at large. Darwin's theory of evolution talks about survival of the fittest, which emphasizes on the adaptablity to the adverse situations as a quintessential quality to live to see another day. This theory is very much and all the more relevant in present scenario given the VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) nature of the world. But what are the essential qualities, you may wonder. Thanks to the authors T N Hari and Sanjay Swami.... </p>

      <p>The movie's storyline is very straight forward: How travel can change one's outlook about life. Of late, in Kollywood cinema, this pattern can be seen where there is a depressed person(men, mostly) who would climb on their Royal Enfield bike and then set off to the Himalayan mountains; when they return, they become a refined soul. So, is this movie any different from the stereotypical portrayal?! Ah, you can't get to the verdict right in the first paragraph :D</p>

      <p>It's a common saying which goes like 'Marriages are made in Heaven'; but we all know that the couple should still lead their lives on (beautiful yet complicated) Earth!! All of us want and yearn for a happy, peaceful, fun filled and satisfying married life and a partner who would support, defend, and handhold us in this journey. But very rarely do we come across couples who have achieved this stature. This book 'Row, Row, Row your Boat' is a book written by couple therapists, Sophia and Roopak(a couple themselves!!), who turned around their married life which was on the verge of collapse with therapy's help. This is a short but insightful read on little things that couples could do 'together' to reach their vision of becoming a made-for-each-other couple, which apparently was their original vow when they got married but may have fizzled out as years passed by. </p>
