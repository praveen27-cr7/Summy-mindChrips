Communication is the lifeline of any relationship- be it personal or professional. Interestingly, while our educational system prepares us for communication in a formal setting - such as delivering a presentation, writing clear emails, rehearsed conversations etc., it doesnâ€™t coach us for speaking in an informal setting...</p>

Perhaps, this is why, no matter how many movies are done around the central theme of love, new ones with fresh perspective like "Lover" still is celebrated by the audience.</p>

This theory is very much and all the more relevant in present scenario given the VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) nature of the world.

All of us want and yearn for a happy, peaceful, fun filled and satisfying married life and a partner who would support, defend, and handhold us in this journey. But very rarely do we come across couples who have achieved this stature. This book 'Row, Row, Row your Boat' is a book written by couple therapists, Sophia and Roopak(a couple themselves!!), who turned around their married life which was on the verge of collapse with therapy's help. This is a short but insightful read on little things that couples could do 'together' to reach their vision of becoming a made-for-each-other couple, which apparently was their original vow when they got married but may have fizzled out as years passed by. </p>
